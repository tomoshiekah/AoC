These are my Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) (in Java), [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) (in Java) and [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) (in Python).

They are <br>
a) not complete and *(especially 2022, lol)* <br>
b) not commentated or written in an easily readable way and <br>
c) probably not the best or even good.

*(and the last days (16/17) of 2021 probably don't work properly, idk)*
