These are my Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) (in Java), [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) (in Java), [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) (in Python) and [2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) (in Java, again..).

They are <br>
a) not complete and *(especially 2022, lol)* <br>
b) not commentated or written in an easily readable way and <br>
c) probably not good. (but they mostly work, that's enough)

*(and the last days (16/17) of 2021 and days 10/11 of 2023 probably don't work properly, idk)*
